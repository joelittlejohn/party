  Expose a registered service publicly (through Gatekeeper) so that it can
  be accessed by clients via api/sapi/private domains. Be sure to think
  hard about what restrictions to apply to your resource *before*
  exposing it.

  An example for a careops resource:

  (expose! service [:get :post] {:role [\"care\"]
                                 :domain [\"private\"]
                                 :ip [\"internal\"]})

  An example user-authenticated resource (supports oauth1, noa oauth2,
  jagus oauth2, etc):

  (expose! service [:get :post] {:role [\"user\"]})

  *Note*: You must (register!) your service before it can be exposed."
